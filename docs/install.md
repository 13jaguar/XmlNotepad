## Install XML Notepad

There are two ways to install XML Notepad:
1. [ClickOnceÂ® installer](http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/XmlNotepad/setup.exe) - this is the most convenient, install it directly from the web browser.
2. [Standalone downloadable installer](http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/XmlNotepad/XmlNotepadsetup.zip) if you need something that works offline.
Just download the zip file, copy it to the machine you want to install it on, unzip the file on that machine and run `xmlnotepadsetup.msi`.

### Troubleshooting

If you have trouble installing the ClickOnce installer package, try a Microsoft Web Browser.  Chrome sometimes does the wrong thing.  Do not attempt to download the setup.exe from [http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/XmlNotepad/setup.exe](http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/XmlNotepad/setup.exe) and install it offline.

ClickOnce only works when you "click" the link in the web browser.  This is actually a security feature.  ClickOnce is verifying the that package it is installing actually came from [http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/XmlNotepad/setup.exe](http://www.lovettsoftware.com/downloads/XmlNotepad/setup.exe) and nowhere else.  This ensures the package has not been tampered with.
