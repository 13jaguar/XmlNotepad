## Analytics

In order to understand which features are important XML Notepad records anonymous usage like:

1. how many times the app is used
2. how many times each feature is used (options, xslt, search, etc)

The data is collected using Google Analytics and shared only with members of the XML Notepad development team.
The data is used to prioritize future work to improve the features that are most popular.

Analytics can be enabled or disabled any time using the "Allow analytics" option in the [Options dialog](options.md).
