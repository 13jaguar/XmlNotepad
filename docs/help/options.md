### Color Theme, Colors and Fonts
The options dialog allows you to select a color theme, light or dark, or configure the specific colors used in each type of node as well as the font used and the background color. A drop down arrow on each color lets you pick from different color palettes. You can also customize the font that is used in the XML Notepad tree view.

### Formatting
You can also configure the formatting options that are used when you save an XML file, or turn off formatting altogether.

### Language
Specify which language annotations to pick from associated XSD schemas.

### Long Lines
How to deal with editing of long lines.

### Updates

You can also configure the auto-update mechanism associated with
the ClickOnce installer. If the "Enable updates" field is true, then XML Notepad will ping the specified "Update Location" for an "Updates.xml" file to see if a new version of XML Notepad is available. See [Updates](/XmlNotepad/help/updates) for more information on how this works.

### Validation
You can turn off DTD validation.

### XmlDiff
Options that control how the XmlDiff works when you compare XML
documents.
